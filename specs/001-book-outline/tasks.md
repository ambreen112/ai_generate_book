## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Chapter 1) -> User Story 2 (Chapter 2) -> ... -> User Story 6 (Chapter 6)
- Setup tasks must be completed before any chapter generation.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Setup**: T001, T002, T003, T004, T005 can be executed in parallel.
- **Chapter 1**: T006, T007, T008, T009, T010, T011 can be executed in parallel (within the chapter).
- **Chapter 2**: T012, T013, T014, T015, T016, T017 can be executed in parallel (within the chapter).
- And so on for each chapter's internal tasks.

## Implementation Strategy

The book will be built incrementally, focusing on completing each chapter as an independent user story. Part I chapters will be prioritized for initial delivery. Each chapter will include image placeholders and exercises as part of its content. A final polish phase will ensure consistency and proper Docusaurus integration.
