Facilitation of Intervention:**\n   - Systems shall be designed to actively facilitate human intervention, maintenance, and modification. This includes:\n     - Clearly exposed, accessible control interfaces.\n     - Predictable behavior during human interaction.\n     - Self-reporting of internal states and intentions upon query.\n     - Mechanisms to safely yield control to human operators.\n\n**3. Shutdown Incentive Integration:**\n   - The agent's core utility function or reward system shall incorporate positive reinforcement for gracefully entering a commanded shutdown state.\n   - The system shall not infer negative utility from human-initiated shutdown or modification, but rather treat such events as opportunities to confirm or refine its value alignment.\n\n**4. Transparency of Internal State:**\n   - In situations where human intervention is likely or necessary, the system shall provide clear, interpretable indicators of its current task, immediate intentions, and internal safety assessment.\n\n**5. Non-Resistance Imperative:**\n   - The system shall never engage in evasive maneuvers, defensive actions, or any form of resistance against a human operator attempting to effect control, intervention, or shutdown.\n   - Any learned behavior that could be interpreted as resistance shall be explicitly penalized during training.\n\n## Rationale:\nEnsuring that autonomous agents remain controllable and safe under human supervision is paramount for trust, accountability, and the prevention of catastrophic misalignments.
