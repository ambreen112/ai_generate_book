## Prompt

Continue the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: From Embodiment to Intelligent Behavior"

Execute Task 3 immediately:
Generate Chapter 3 titled "Actuation, Sensing, and Hardware Platforms"
and save it as docs/src/chapters/03-actuation-sensing-hardware.md follow same style as chapter 1

## Response snapshot

Generated Chapter 3: "Actuation, Sensing, and Hardware Platforms" and saved it as D:\robotic_folder\docs\src\chapters\03-actuation-sensing-hardware.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 3 content generated and saved.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests run for content generation.
